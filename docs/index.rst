Welcome to metis's documentation!
=====================================

**Metis** is a research code that allows to carry out dynamical simulations of mechanical systems. The main feature is the possibility to test and compare different integration schemes. In principle, two different types of analysis can be carried out:

a. Single analysis: allows the integration of movement equations at a constant time step size. Output are quantities like energy, energy differences, the system's state variables and constraint evaluations (among others) as a function of time.


b. Error analysis: the movemente equations are solved at different time step sizes Œîùë°ùëñ . The output is aconvergence analysis with the error as a function of the time step size.

   This project is under active development.
