Thanks to the questions raised by Jan Br√ºdigam ([@janbruedigam](https://github.com/janbruedigam)), we found a small mistake in the input-script concerning the double-four-bar mechanism.

The corrected startscript is provided as well as the original one. The small changes affect only the initial velocities of the directors leading to a slightly better approximation of the period length of the vibration (cf. Figs. 12 and 13 in the [publication](https://doi.org/10.1007/s11044-023-09889-6)), now matching even better the results from [Bayo & Avello](https://doi.org/10.1007/BF00045677) (1994) and [Roupa et al.](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mechmachtheory.2022.105134) (2023.).
