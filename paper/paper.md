# Summary

The Matlab code framework `metis` is ...

# Statement of need

Geometric or `structure-preserving` integration [@hairer_geometric_2006].


Energy-momentum methods using discrete gradients (see, e.g. [@gonzalez_time_1996]) or variational integrators [@lew2016brief], [@marsden_discrete_2001], which have been extended to DAEs in [@leyendecker_variational_2008].

Hamiltonian dynamics with or without constraints [@leimkuhler_simulating_2005], also systems governed by DAEs [@kunkel_differential-algebraic_2006] are feasible.

Rigid body dynamics in terms of directors [@betsch2001constrained].


Simulation of port-Hamiltonian systems [@duindam_modeling_2009].



`metis` has been recently used in the authors works [@kinon_ggl_2023],[kinon_structure_2023]. based on Livens principle [@livens_hamiltons_1919].
