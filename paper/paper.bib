  volume   = {6},
  abstract = {This paper develops a formalism for the design of conserving time-integration schemes for Hamiltonian systems with symmetry. The main result is that, through the introduction of a discrete directional derivative, implicit second-order conserving schemes can be constructed for general systems which preserve the Hamiltonian along with a certain class of other first integrals arising from affine symmetries. Discrete Hamiltonian systems are introduced as formal abstractions of conserving schemes and are analyzed within the context of discrete dynamical systems; in particular, various symmetry and stability properties are investigated.},

  abstract   = {Energy exchange is a major foundation of the dynamics of physical systems, and, hence, in the study of complex multi-domain systems, methodologies that explicitly describe the topology of energy exchanges are instrumental in structuring the modeling and the computation of the system's dynamics and its control. This book is the outcome of the European Project "Geoplex" (FP5 IST-2001-34166) that studied and extended such system modeling and control methodologies. This unique book starts from the basic concept of port-based modeling, and extends it to port-Hamiltonian systems. This generic paradigm is applied to various physical domains, showing its power and unifying flexibility for real multi-domain systems.},

The book includes numerous specific applications, making it beneficial to physicists and engineers. Specific examples and applications show how the theory works, backed by up-to-date techniques, all of which make the text accessible to a wide variety of readers, especially senior undergraduates and graduates in mathematics, physics and engineering. This second edition has been rewritten and updated for clarity throughout, with a major revamping and expansion of the exercises.
